# Type-Samurai

## Overview

**Type-Samurai** is a tool designed to help typists track their typing speed (words per minute, WPM) on a per-word basis. The goal is to identify words that are typed slower, allowing users to focus on practicing these "weaker" words and improve their overall typing speed and accuracy. By targeting words that consistently slow down typing tests, Type-Samurai aims to create a more well-rounded typing ability, ensuring that all words in a given set can be typed efficiently.

## Motivation

When typing on platforms like Monkeytype, the WPM can vary significantly depending on the words presented during a test. It was observed that users tend to achieve higher WPM scores when familiar and easy-to-type words appear more frequently. Conversely, tests can feel more challenging and slower when less familiar or difficult words are included.

Type-Samurai was created to address this inconsistency by:

1. **Tracking WPM for Each Word:** By recording the typing speed for each word, Type-Samurai provides detailed insights into which words are slowing down performance.
2. **Focusing Practice on Weaker Words:** By sorting words by their average WPM, users can identify and practice the slowest words, systematically improving their speed on these words.

## Features

- **Detailed WPM Tracking:** Logs and tracks WPM for each word typed during tests.
- **Custom Word Sets:** Allows the creation of custom word sets for practice.
- **Sorted Word Selection:** Users can sort words by their average WPM and select specific sets, such as the slowest 25 words, to focus practice.
- **Progress Monitoring:** As users practice, they can monitor the improvement in their typing speed on previously challenging words.

## Getting Started

To start using Type-Samurai, clone the repository and set up the environment as per the instructions in the setup guide. The application consists of a client-side interface built with React (using TypeScript) and a backend API for managing data and tracking performance.

## Future Development

Future updates may include advanced analytics, personalized training routines, and integration with popular typing platforms for seamless experience tracking.
